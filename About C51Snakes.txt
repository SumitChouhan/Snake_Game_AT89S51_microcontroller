Hello 8051 dudes,

 Welcome to C51Snakes - The Nokia inspired Sankes game implemented on 8051 platform.
The game is built on AT89S51 MCU operating at 27MHz crystal frequency. The game uses
a 16 * 8 LED dot matrix display and five way keys for user interface. A dedicated
delay settings key provides one touch access to the delay settings mode where the
speed of the Snake can be adjusted. Highlights of the game are,

    * As in the original game, the Snake grows in size as it snatches the eggs
    * Eggs appear periodically on the screen at random pixels and will disappear
      if not snatched within a certain period of time
    * The snake sees no boundaries at the edges of the display, will propagate
      in to any edge and enter from the opposite edge
    * The Snake can be accelerated / decelerated on the fly
    * There is also a separate delay settings mode to adjust the Snake's speed
    * The game ends when the Snake collides with itself
    * The total eggs snatched is then displayed as the game score
    * The gaming console will hibernate if no user event occurs in 25secs! The
      game can be resumed by pressing external interrupt / master reset keys!

 So, hurry! Build the hardware, burn the code and start gaming...
